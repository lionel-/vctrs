\description{
This is a function for developers to use when extending vctrs. It casts
a list to a more specific vectoring type, keeping the length constant.
It does this by discarding (with a warning), any elements after the 1.
It is called from \code{vec_cast.XYZ.list()} methods to preserve symmetry with
\code{vec_cast.list.XYZ()}.
