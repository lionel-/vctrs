\title{rcrd (record) S3 class}
\usage{
new_rcrd(fields, ..., data = NULL, class = character())
}
\arguments{
\item{fields}{A list or a data frame. Lists must be rectangular
(same sizes), and contain uniquely named vectors (at least
one). \code{fields} is validated with \code{\link[=df_list]{df_list()}} which recycles
columns to the same size.}

\item{...}{Additional attributes}

\item{data}{\ifelse{html}{\out{<a href='https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental'><img src='figures/lifecycle-experimental.svg' alt='Experimental lifecycle'></a>}}{\strong{Experimental}} Optionally, a
vector acting as the main data field. This is useful for
implementing lists and data frames records.}

\item{class}{Name of subclass.}
}
\description{
The rcrd class extends \link{vctr}. A rcrd is composed of 1 or more \link{field}s,
which must be vectors of the same length. Is designed specifically for
classes that can naturally be decomposed into multiple vectors of the same
length, like \link{POSIXlt}, but where the organisation should be considered
an implementation detail invisible to the user (unlike a \link{data.frame}).
